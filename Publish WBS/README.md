When you work on F&O Implementation and implementing project operations or Project management and accounting module you always come across Work breakdown structure. Data migration is very complex process in WBS. I have blogged about WBS and performing Data migration at  WBS in my blog post. 
Once you complete Data migration, you need to publish WBS so that you can start scheduling activities. This code in this utility publishes WBS in bulk for projects specified in file. It accepts a simple excel file with single column which contains project ID and publishes WBS for those projects.
