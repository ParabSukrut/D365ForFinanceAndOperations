Importing project resources in Dynamics 365 For Finance and operations can be performed in multiple ways. Couple of them are below
1. Using custom script 
2. During automation, For example while performing Scheduling through custom power app and you have a requirement to add a resource on demand.

I have added two projects in this repo, first is "ASP_AddResocesOnProjects" xpp file which contains a script which can be executed using my runnable class utility which exist in this repo.
Another project is "ASP_ResourceImportThrouhAPI" which is nothing but a custom service in F&O which can be called using Power Automate. I have blogged about this in the past which you can find on my blog site below.
