This This folder has two artifacts. One is axpp file for D365 F&O project which has code for Business event and other one is power automate flow which consumes this business event, download the file from F&O and copies that file to blob storage. For data import export framework there is no out of the box business event present in F&O. 

How to use this business event – One you download the file, import project using visual studio and build the code. Synchronize the database and refresh entities from data management workspace so that custom entity is visible for data export. Rebuild the Business event Catalog from the System administrator > set up > business event page. Once rebuilding is done Business event with name “Data management project execution Business Event” should be visible in the catalog. Please refer below blog to configure end to end flow.
